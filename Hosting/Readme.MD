1. core Concept: What is Hosting?

Definition: Hosting is essentially renting a remote computer (server) from a provider  that stays online 24/7 so people can access your files or app from anywhere.

2. Types of Hosting Explained

Shared Hosting: You share a single server's resources (CPU, RAM) with many other users. It is cheaper but can be slower.

Dedicated Hosting: You rent an entire physical server just for yourself. It offers maximum control and performance.

Managed Hosting: The provider handles the technical setup and maintenance for you (e.g., specialized WordPress hosting) so you can focus on content.

3. Step-by-Step Practical Workflow

Rent a Server: Purchase a Virtual Private Server (VPS) from a provider (e.g., Hostinger) to get your own IP address, username, and password.

Connect to Server: Use a terminal command called SSH (Secure Shell) to remotely log in to your rented server.

Transfer Files: Use a software called FileZilla to drag and drop your code files from your computer to the server easily.

Go Live: Install a web server software like Apache on the remote machine to serve your HTML files to the public internet.
